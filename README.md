# WebScanner-Tool

# This tool helps the user to recon any domain and url just by typing them when ever the code runs.

To run this tool in your windows device, first download and save all the python files in a single folder then run all the files individually except the main.py, that needs to be executed at last. Whilst running the code you may need to install few dependencies, after which you can easily run the main.py file. The desired results would be stored in a new folder created inside the parent folder.
